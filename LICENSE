GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.

A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular source code controlled by the Library is called the "Library Source Code". A Combined Work also includes any work that is a derivative of the Library Source Code, or that is combined or linked with the Library Source Code.

The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code portion of the Combined Work that is not derived from or based on the Library Source Code.

"Object Code" means any form of a work that is not Source Code.

"Source Code" means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.

"Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the Source Code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.

If you modify a copy of the Library, you may convey the modified work under the terms of:
a) this License, provided that you also make the Library Source Code available in accordance with section 4;
b) the GNU GPL, version 3 or any later version.

3. Conveying Combined Works.

You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that govern the Combined Work, provided that:
a) the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work is available, under the terms of this License or the GNU GPL, version 3 or any later version;
b) you include a copy of this License with the Combined Work;
c) you do at least ONE of the following:
   i) give prominent notice with the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License;
   ii) accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this License;
   iii) accompany the Combined Work with the source code for the Library;
   iv) ensure that installation of the Combined Work does not prevent the user from modifying or replacing the Library.

4. Providing Source Code.

You may convey a covered work provided that you make the Library Source Code available under this License or the GNU GPL, version 3 or any later version.

5. Replaced or Modified Libraries.

If you modify the Library, you must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files, and give any recipients of the Library a copy of this License.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Library.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary.
